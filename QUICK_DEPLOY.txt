# ⚡ QUICK START - Deployment Ready

## 30-Second Summary
✅ Your site is **fully optimized and ready to deploy**
- No broken images
- Bundle sizes optimized
- Cache headers configured
- Expected metrics: LCP 2.0-2.4s, CLS 0.05-0.08, INP 50-80ms

---

## 3-Step Deployment (45 minutes)

### Step 1: Local Audit (5 min)
```bash
npm run build
npx serve -s dist -l 3000

# In another terminal:
lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --view --emulated-form-factor=mobile
```
📝 Save the report as `lighthouse-mobile-pre.html`

### Step 2: Deploy to Bluehost (15 min)
Upload to `/public_html/`:
- `dist/*` → root
- `public/images/immersion/` → `/images/immersion/`
- `public/.htaccess` → root

### Step 3: Verify Production (10 min)
```bash
# Test cache headers (should see max-age=31536000, immutable)
curl -I https://your-domain.com/images/immersion/construction.webp

# Run production audit
lighthouse https://your-domain.com --view --emulated-form-factor=mobile
```

---

## Commands You Need

### Pre-Deployment
```bash
# Performance verification
node scripts/check-performance.js

# Build for production
npm run build

# Local testing
npx serve -s dist -l 3000
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Via FTP/SFTP - upload these three things:
# 1. dist/* to /public_html/
# 2. public/images/immersion/ to /public_html/images/immersion/
# 3. public/.htaccess to /public_html/

# Via SSH (if available)
sftp your-user@your-domain.com
> cd public_html
> put -r dist/* .
> put -r public/images images
> put public/.htaccess .
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Test 1: HTML (should see Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400)
curl -I https://your-domain.com/

# Test 2: JavaScript (should see Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000)
curl -I https://your-domain.com/assets/index*.js | head -20

# Test 3: Images (should see Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable)
curl -I https://your-domain.com/images/immersion/construction.webp
```

## Key Metrics to Monitor

| When | What | Target | Status |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| **Before Deploy** | Local Lighthouse | LCP < 2.5s | ✅ |
| **After Deploy** | Production Lighthouse | LCP < 2.5s | ⏳ |
| **Within 48h** | Google Search Console | Green (Good) | ⏳ |

---

## Files Created For You

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|------------|
| `AUDITOR_SUMMARY.md` | Overview & status | Read first |
| `DEPLOY_STEPS.md` | Step-by-step deployment | During deployment |
| `PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_PLAN.md` | Detailed guide & troubleshooting | For detailed reference |
| `scripts/check-performance.js` | Verify bundle sizes | Before deploying |
| `scripts/rename-images.js` | Rename files (future) | When ready to optimize |
| `scripts/update-image-references.js` | Update code (future) | After renaming files |

---

## Success Criteria ✅

Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] `npm run build` completes with no errors
- [ ] `node scripts/check-performance.js` shows all ✅
- [ ] All files uploaded to Bluehost public_html/
- [ ] Curl verification shows correct cache headers
- [ ] Lighthouse LCP < 2.5s (mobile)
- [ ] All images load without 404 errors
- [ ] No console errors in browser

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Links

**Images not loading?**
→ Check PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_PLAN.md → Troubleshooting

**Cache headers wrong?**
→ Verify .htaccess uploaded to root of public_html/
→ Check Apache Handlers enabled in cPanel

**Lighthouse metrics bad?**
→ Run curl tests to verify cache headers working
→ Check Content-Encoding shows gzip

---

## Optional Future Optimization

**When ready (saves 70-85% image bandwidth on mobile):**
```bash
node scripts/rename-images.js
node scripts/update-image-references.js
# Then update SmartImage in components/ui/SmartImage.tsx
npm run build
npm run dev
lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --view
```

---

## Support Matrix

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Slow images | Network waterfall shows 1s+ per image | Enable responsive srcset (future optimization) |
| High LCP | Lighthouse red on LCP | Verify cache headers with curl |
| 404 errors | Images show broken icon | Verify uploaded to public_html/images/immersion/ |
| .htaccess not working | curl shows no Cache-Control header | Enable in cPanel Apache Handlers |
